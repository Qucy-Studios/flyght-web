# Flyght 

This repository contains the official, public source code for the Flyght website with editor. It is written in
Next.js by an amateur Next.js (and React) developer who came from a Svelte background, so enjoy the source code!

## What is Flyght?

Flyght is a Discord bot that brings a Know-Your-Member system (similar to Facebook Group's Membership Questions) to Discord servers, enabling Discord communities to build better for their community by knowing what their people prefer. It differs from Discord's own native onboarding system in that it allows you to receive the responses and allow people who are specifically for your community.
